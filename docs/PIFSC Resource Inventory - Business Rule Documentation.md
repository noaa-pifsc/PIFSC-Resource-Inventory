# PIFSC Resource Inventory Business Rule Documentation

## Overview:
There are multiple modules that utilize the PIFSC Resource Inventory (PRI) Database for various purposes and each module has its own set of business rules that only apply to that module. In addition there are some business rules that apply to the underlying database and therefore all associated modules.
